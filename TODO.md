Currently working on:
    sword-select.js -   turning abilties into passives.
                        Adding new passives.
                        Adding new swords.
TODO: needs to be a better way to store multiple passives on one sword.

NEED LIST: 
    seperate sword select from reforges and swords.
    Pass all objects to be readable as json.
    Add a constructor method to make objects from toString.
    Turn abilities into passives.
    add another folder for layout and nav components.
    change between highest dps and highest dmg per attack.
    damage limiter. eg keep dmg at 13000 but maximise rest in speed/intel etc.
    swap everything from objects to props. makes it better i think, idk
    refactor sword enchants by making sword enchants object. Make it so that you dont need to have a million entries in the manual, just an object.
