Currently working on:
    sword-select.js - problems with two children and same key for the reforge.

NEED LIST: 
    sort/add more folders so everything is organized
    change between highest dps and highest dmg per attack.
    damage limiter. eg keep dmg at 13000 but maximise rest in speed/intel etc.
    Add recombobulator.
    Fix sword select and manual showing sword reforges and sword stats and abilities etc.
    populate sword-select.js with all swords
    swap everything from objects to props. makes it better i think, idk
    refactor sword enchants by making sword enchants object. Make it so that you dont need to have a million entries in the manual, just an object.
    potions.js
    armour.js
    armour-reforges.js
    ability to add all stats together. This will be in manual.
    ability to add extra damage for weapon bonus (percentages). This will be in manual.
    caluclate damage to different mobs
