Currently working on:
    sword-select.js - problems with inability to find rarity when switching sword then recombobulating. probs because value is no longer an object and just a string now...

NEED LIST: 
    Pass all objects to json.
    Add more reforges
    add another folder for layout and nav components.
    change between highest dps and highest dmg per attack.
    damage limiter. eg keep dmg at 13000 but maximise rest in speed/intel etc.
    Add recombobulator.
    Fix sword select and manual showing sword reforges and sword stats and abilities etc.
    populate sword-select.js with all swords
    swap everything from objects to props. makes it better i think, idk
    refactor sword enchants by making sword enchants object. Make it so that you dont need to have a million entries in the manual, just an object.
    potions.js
    armour.js
    armour-reforges.js
    ability to add all stats together. This will be in manual.
    ability to add extra damage for weapon bonus (percentages). This will be in manual.
    caluclate damage to different mobs
